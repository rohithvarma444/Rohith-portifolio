## Development Environment

My core development environment consists of carefully chosen tools that maximize productivity while maintaining code quality:

- **VS Code**: My primary editor, extensively customized with productivity-enhancing extensions
- **iTerm2**: A powerful terminal emulator with custom shortcuts and profiles
- **Fig.io**: AI-powered terminal autocomplete that saves countless keystrokes

## Frontend Framework Ecosystem

The JavaScript ecosystem continues to evolve, and I've settled on a stack that provides the perfect balance of performance and developer experience:

- **Next.js 14**: The foundation of my frontend applications
- **React**: Still the most versatile UI library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development without context switching

## Version Control & Collaboration

Effective collaboration is crucial for any developer:

- **Git**: Version control with custom aliases and workflows
- **GitHub**: Project management and code collaboration
- **Linear**: Issue tracking and sprint planning

This stack has dramatically improved my productivity and code quality. What's your development stack looking like in 2025?
